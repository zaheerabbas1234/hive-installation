Hive Installation Guidelines

1. Prerequisite: Hadoop 3.2.4 (Watch my video to install hadoop 3.2.4) https://youtu.be/kUX6dCbdU3Q

2. Download and Configure Apache Derby:
	a) Download Derby 10.14.2.0 (It's Compatible to Hadoop 3.2.4 ) from https://db.apache.org/derby/derby_downloads.html  
	b) Extract the file using WinRar, 7Zip, or similar software.  
	c) Copy the extracted folder to `C:\` and rename it to `derby` (e.g., `C:\derby`).  

3. Download and Configure Apache Hive Binaries:
	a) Download Hive 3.1.2 (It's Compatible to Hadoop 3.2.4 ) from https://archive.apache.org/dist/hive/hive-3.1.2/ 
	b) Extract the file using WinRar, 7Zip, or similar software.  
	c) Copy the extracted folder to `C:\` and rename it to `hive` (e.g., `C:\hive`).  
	d) Navigate to `C:\derby\lib` and copy all the `*.jar` files.  
	e) Paste the copied `*.jar` files into `C:\hive\lib`.  
	f) Download the exact `hive-site.xml` file from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_h8dN46KK8zZf9yf2M2DBUfPR_IZl33T/view  
	g) Copy the downloaded `hive-site.xml` file and paste it to `C:\hive\conf` folder.

4. Cross Check guava-x.y-jre file:
	a) Make sure C:\hive\lib  must have same version of guava-x.y-jar file as Hadoop version: C:\hadoop\share\hadoop\common\lib
	 For example: C:\hadoop\share\hadoop\common\lib\guava-27.0-jre.jar
	 Then C:\hive\lib\guava-27.0-jre.jar
	 b) If not just copy the Hadoop verison guava-27.0-jre.jar and paste into C:\hive\lib and delete the other version guava-x.y-jre.jar file

5. Create a temporary folder named 'tmp' into C:\hive (e.g, C:\hive\tmp) and provide all rights by setting the properties of folder

6. Set Up Environmental Variables:
	-  DERBY_HOME : C:\derby
        -  HADOOP_HOME : C:\hadoop
	-  HIVE_HOME : C:\hive
	-  HIVE_BIN : C:\hive\bin
	-  HIVE_LIB : C:\hive\lib
	-  HADOOP_USER_CLASSPATH_FIRST: true

7. Download and Configure Wget:
	a) Download wget zip files from https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/ 
	b) Extract the wget zip files.  
	c) Copy the extracted folder to `C:\` and rename it to `wget` (e.g., `C:\wget`).  
	d) Set the 'path' for wget in Environmental Variables: `C:\wget`.

8. Download Windows Version of Hive Bin:
	a) Navigate to a specific directory and create a folder of your choice (e.g., `C:\bin`).  
	b) Open Windows Command Prompt and run:
   		wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -R index.html https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hive/trunk/bin/

	c) Navigate to `C:\bin` and its subdirectories until you reach the `bin` folder.  
	d) Copy the inner `bin` folder.  
	e) Navigate to `C:\hive`, delete the existing `bin` folder, and replace it with the downloaded `bin` folder.

9. Run the Hadoop deamons:
	a) Command to run deamons: start-all.cmd
	b) Commands to check deamons running: jps

10. Run Derby Server
	a) Command: `StartNetworkServer -h 0.0.0.0`

11. To Initialize Hive Schema:
	a) Navigate to `C:\hive\bin` and run below command: hive --service schematool -dbType derby -initSchema
   
12. Start Hive:
	a) Command: `hive`

13. Success!: You will be prompted with the Hive command line, ready to run SQL commands.

14. Congratulations!
